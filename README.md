# Online Shopping Management System (C++)

## Overview
This project is a console-based Online Shopping Management System developed in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It models core e-commerce functionalities such as users, products, orders, payments, and shipments through modular class design.

The implementation was reconstructed based on the original academic coursework report, as the source code was not preserved.

## Structure
- include/ — class declarations (headers)
- src/ — class implementations
- main.cpp — application entry point

## Note
This repository represents a functional reconstruction of the original coursework project and is intended for academic demonstration and learning purposes.
